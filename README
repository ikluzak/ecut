ecut 1.2					
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's cut, but with regex instead of the normal cut paramters.

	cat ecut.c | ecut ".+(//.+)"

will display all the comments that don't start a line

	cat ecut.c | ecut "^(//.+)"

will display all the comments that START with // 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version:	1.0
Date:		12/12/2013
Notes:
		This is the initial build of ecut.  

		It's pretty basic at the moment but appears to do what I 
		intended.  I'm sure there are more features to add and error
		checking to include.

Version: 	1.1
Date:		12/15/2013 
Notes:		Added
			- delimeter support
			- man page

Version:	1.2
Date:		12/15/2013
Notes:		Added
			- pass filename on command line instead of requiring stdin
			- autoconf scripts


TO DO:
		- add support for /expression/ matching or flags for case insensitive, etc
		- more error checking

enjoy,
